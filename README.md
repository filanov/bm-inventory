# bm-inventory

## Prerequisites

1. Docker
1. skipper https://github.com/stratoscale/skipper
1. minikube (for tests)
1. kubectl


## First Setup

To push your build target to a Docker registry you first need to change the default target.
1. Create a quay.io or Docker Hub account if you don't already have one. These instructions refer to quay.io, Docker Hub is similar.
1. Create a repository called bm-inventory.
1. Make sure you have your `~/.docker/config.json` file set up to point to your account. For quay.io, you can go to quay.io -> User Settings, and click "Generate Encrypted Password" under "Docker CLI Password".
1. Login to quay.io using `docker login quay.io`.
1. Export the `SERVICE` environment variable to your Docker registry, and pass a tag of your choice, e.g., "test":

```shell script
export SERVICE=quay.io/<username>/bm-inventory:<tag>
```

Do the same for s3-object-expirer:
```shell script
export OBJEXP=quay.io/<username>/s3-object-expirer:<tag>
```

For the first build of the build container run:
`skipper build bm-inventory-build`

## Build

`skipper make all`

### Generate code after swagger changes

After every change in the API (`swagger.yaml`) the code should be generated and the build must pass.

`skipper make generate-from-swagger`

## Tests
Pre-configuration
1. Run minikube on your system.
2. Deploy service, DB and other requirements `skipper make deploy-all`.
3. Wait for all the pods to be up.

Running the tests:

`skipper make subsystem-run`

### Update service for the subsystem tests

if you are making changes and don't want to deploy everything once again you can simple run this command:

`skipper make update && kubectl get pod --namespace assisted-installer -o name | grep bm-inventory | xargs kubectl delete --namespace assisted-installer`

It will build and push a new image of the service to your Docker registry, then delete the service pod from minikube, the deployment will handle the update and pull the new image to start the service again.

## Deployment

### Deploy to minikube

The deployment is a system deployment, it contains all the components the service need for all the operations to work (if implemented).
S3 service (scality), DB and will use the image generator to create the images in the deployed S3 and create relevant bucket in S3.

`skipper make deploy-all`

### Deploy to OpenShift

Besides default minikube deployment, the service support deployment to OpenShift cluster using ingress as the access point to the service.

`skipper make deploy-all TARGET=oc-ingress`

This deployment option have multiple optional parameters that should be used in case you are not the Admin of the cluster:
1. `APPLY_NAMESPACE` - True by default. Will try to deploy "assisted-installer" namespace, if you are not the Admin of the cluster or maybe you don't have permissions for this operation you may skip namespace deployment.
1. `INGRESS_DOMAIN` - By default deployment script will try to get the domain prefix from OpenShift ingress controller. If you don't have access to it then you may specify the domain yourself. For example: `apps.ocp.prod.psi.redhat.com`

To set the parameters simply add them in the end of the command, for example
`skipper make deploy-all TARGET=oc-ingress APPLY_NAMESPACE=False INGRESS_DOMAIN=apps.ocp.prod.psi.redhat.com`

Note: All deployment configurations are under the `deploy` directory in case more detailed configuration is required.

### Deploy UI

This service support optional UI deployment.

`skipper make deploy-ui`

For OpenShift users, look at the service deployment options on OpenShift platform.
