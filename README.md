1. docker
2. skipper https://github.com/stratoscale/skipper
3. minikube (for tests)
4. kubectl


## First Setup

To push your build target to a docker registry you first need to change the default target, export `SERVICE` environment variable to your docker registry

```shell script
export SERVICE=<registry>/<image-name>:<tag>
```

For the first build of the build container run:
`skipper build bm-inventory-build`

## Build

`skipper make all` will only

### Generate code after swagger changes

After every change in the api (swagger.yaml) the code should be generated and the build must pass

`skipper make generate-from-swagger`

## Tests
Pre-configuration
1. Run minikube on your system.
2. Deploy service, DB and other requirements `skipper make deploy-for-test`
3. Wait for all the pods to be up.

Running the tests:

`skipper make subsystem-run`

If a full system is deployed a more advanced tests can be run on it, to run all the tests (will work only if `skipper make deploy-all` is used) add `SYSTEM=1` to `subsystem-run` command. The downside is that this will download and execute external dependencies so if they are bugged it will be dificult to understand if the problem is with the service or with external components. To run the full tests suite use:

`skipper make subsystem-run SYSTEM=1`

To add tests that will run will run only as part of the full system add `system-test` in the description of the test:

```go
var _ = Describe("system-test image tests", func() {
...
}
```

### Update service for the subsystem tests

if you are making changes and don't want to deploy everything once again you can simple run this command

`skipper make update && kubectl get pod -o name | grep bm-inventory | xargs kubectl delete`

if will build and push a new image of the service to your docker registry, then delete the service pod from minikube, the deployment will handle the update and pull the new image to start the service again.

## Deployment

There are two types of deployment in this service, one for subsystem test that deploy only the service and DB, those are the most basic components that the service need to run with out external services, APIs to external services like image creation are dummy.

`skipper make deploy-for-test`

The Other deployment is a system deployment it contain all the components the service need for all the operations to work (if implemented).
This option will deploy S3 service (scality), DB and will use the image generator to create the images in the deployed S3 and create relevant bucket in S3.

`skipper make deploy-all`
